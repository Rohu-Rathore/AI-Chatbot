# AI-Chatbot

Project Overview

It is my Python project of an AI chatbot for college enquiry. As students, we all know how frustrating it can be to navigate the various departments and resources available at our college. Often, finding information about courses, schedules, and other college-related queries can be a time-consuming and inefficient process.

To address this problem, we decided to create an AI chatbot that can provide quick and accurate responses to frequently asked questions about college. The chatbot is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, allowing students to easily access the information they need in a conversational format.

Project Structure

The project is structured into different modules, each serving a specific purpose:

.User Interface: A web interface or command-line interface for interacting with users.
.Natural Language Processing (NLP): Processes and interprets user inputs.
.Response Generation: Generates relevant responses using predefined data and machine learning models.
.Memory Dump Extraction: Special module for extracting and interpreting memory dumps based on user queries.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

System Design
The system consists of the following components:

.User Interface: Collects input from users and displays responses.
.NLP Module: Processes the input using word tokenization and lemmatization.
.Machine Learning: Trains on provided datasets and improves response accuracy over time.
.Database: Stores user interactions and memory dump information for future use.
.Response Generation: Retrieves and generates appropriate responses to queries.
